 <p> Grammy-winning rock quartet Tool established themselves as one of America's most enduring and unpredictable acts with their evolving whole of muscular psychoactive sonics. There wry sense of humor and mystical aesthetic attracted a cult-like following of devoted fans. Their greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of rock-and-roll. They also made multi-sectioned, bedded songs as if they were classical composers.  They additionally paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Formed in Los Angeles by percussionist Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst of the early '90s. This helped them slip into the scene during the post-Nirvana era. Buffered by a prime slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, their debut album Undertow, rocketed to platinum status. Fervor for the band even resurrected their first effort on the Billboard charts. Unfortunately, while they were in the studio recording a follow-up, D'Amour amicably parted ways with Tool and his spot was filled by Justin Chancellor. After 13 years they made 2 new albums and embarked on a sold-out arena tour of the U.S. and capped their successful comeback with a pair of Grammy nominations for "7empest" and "Fear Inoculum." This scored them a Grammy in 2020 for Best Metal Performance.
